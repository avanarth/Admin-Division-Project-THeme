title: A World Divided:
tagline: A Graphical Comparison
rationale statement: The motivation behind this project was to find analyze the admin data from countries across the world to see if population, the number of minority groups present in the country, type of government or the total % of population had an effect on the number of administrative divisions in a country. My wish for the project is to assemble all this data from API's or webscrapping to create graphs, charts and other visual manifestiation of data so that clear trends (or lack thereof) can clearly be seen. If there are clear trends shown from the data, hopefully this knowledge can help poltical scientists understand the relation between populations, ethnicity and local administration. 
description: Using a combination of API calls and webscrapping, this project can use its code to pull information from any country, taking a list of administrative divisions and comparing that table to another table with the country's population, sqaure area and other population statistics. The project with then allow graphs and tables to be made so that we can research to find out if there is a relationship between various poltical, ethnic and geographical factors that have an impact on the amount of local administration division a particular nation develops. I am also developing a webpage that will take this data and display the graphs or charts in an asethically pleasing way. Using the data of a couple randomn countries, I will then argue in favor or against my argument depending on what the data shows.  
workflow: Libraries I have used to assemble code for the project include using API requests on  kamikazechaser's free api administrative-division-db github page [https://github.com/kamikazechaser/administrative-divisions-db] and webscraping from the website the administrative divisions are coming from  [https://www.geonames.org/countries]. From the API, I used pandas to parsed the administrative divisions list into a clear list and turned the administartive divisions list of a few various countries [Argentina, Kenya, Thailand] into a csv format by converting fromk parsed text to a date series and then from a data series to a data frame in csv format. For my web scrapping, I have analyzed the large table of country data and converted it to a data frame that included not only administrative divisions from each country, but their size, population, and other useful information. I used bs4 for this process, so that I have  clear way of pulling other population and size information of nations to comapre the administrative data to itself and with other nations. 
further uses: With the code I have set up for this project, even if my hypothesis on the realationship between population, geoegprahic size or ethnicity on the amount of local administations is incorrect, will be able to be used by others to take out data from various countries and amalgate it together into a csv table very quickly. Coders who need to be able to take population statistic from various countries into their own projects will be able to use the API pulls and/or webscrapping here to put data tables out quickly and efficently. All a users would need to do is put in the data from a single county code and tons of other useful information will pop out and be able to turned into useful tables. 
files list: 
(argenframe.csv) A CSV file with a list of administrative divsion of Argentina, for use as an example nation in my webpage. It is a dateframe taken from the administrative-division-db github page.
(thaiframe.csv) A CSV file with a list of administrative divsion of Thailand, for use as an example nation in my webpage. It is a dateframe taken from the administrative-division-db github page.
(kenframe.csv) A CSV file with a list of administrative divsion of Kenya, for use as an example nation in my webpage. It is a dateframe taken from the administrative-division-db github page.
(country_data.csv) A CSV files that uses a particular country's code to also grab sqaure area, total population and other useful metrics.
